## About

This project was created for fxhash's first birthday, where collections would have 365 mints at 1tez each.

I was in the very early stages of working on FALLiNGWATER, mainly focused on cr4eating buildings and vanishing points. I quickly adapted the code to create these ghostlike textured buildings. In theory the pieces are plottable, but there are so many dots it would take forever to plot, and also the plotter would just stop halfway through. I went on to create a second unpublished version that used lines instead of dots to make it more plottable.

## Running

The files you need are...

```
index.html
  ╰ index.js
  ╰ noise.js
  ╰ paper.js
```

...spin up a local webserver or just opening index.html should do the trick, see instructions.md for, well, instructions.
